# FastAPI Best Architecture

Official documentation: https://fastapi-practices.github.io/fastapi_best_architecture_docs/

Use this skill to follow fba architecture and plugin conventions. Read only the references needed for the task. For cross-layer feature work, read `references/development.md` first, then load the layer-specific references.

## Core Architecture

Project adopts a layered backend architecture centered on API, Service, and CRUD, with Schema and Model as explicit data contracts:

| Layer   | Responsibility                                                     |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| API     | Route processing, parameter validation, and response return        |
| Schema  | Data transfer objects, request/response data structure definitions |
| Service | Business logic, data processing, exception handling                |
| CRUD    | Database operations (inherits `CRUDPlus`)                          |
| Model   | ORM models (inherits `Base`)                                       |

## Development Workflow

1. Define database models (model)
2. Define data validation models (schema)
3. Define routes (router)
4. Write business logic (service)
5. Write database operations (crud)

## Reference Selection

| Task | Read |
|------|------|
| Feature/module development flow, Service/CRUD placement, pagination, cache, Celery, i18n, code generation | `references/development.md` |
| API routes, dependencies, response patterns, auth, permissions | `references/api.md` |
| Pydantic request/response DTOs | `references/schema.md` |
| SQLAlchemy models and migrations | `references/model.md` |
| CRUD, Service, API, Schema, entity and table prefix naming | `references/naming.md` |
| Backend/frontend plugin development and plugin README files | `references/plugin.md` |
| Plugin sharing, public repositories, marketplace PRs, submodules, updates | `references/plugin-sharing.md` |
| Formatting, comments, docstrings, commit style | `references/coding-style.md` |
| Global settings and configuration | `references/config.md` |

## Plugin Work

When creating, reviewing, or updating plugins:

1. Read `references/plugin.md` for plugin type, structure, manifest, configuration, hooks, SQL, and README rules
2. Read `references/plugin-sharing.md` when the task involves sharing, publishing, updating, marketplace PRs, plugin repositories, or Git submodules
3. Prefer source-code behavior from `fastapi-best-architecture` when docs and implementation differ
4. Do not perform git add, commit, push, or PR actions unless the user explicitly asks

## CLI

Execute `fba -h` for more details.
